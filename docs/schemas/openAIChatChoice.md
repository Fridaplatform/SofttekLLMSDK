# OpenAI Chat Choice

A model class for a choice in an OpenAI chat response.

## Attributes

- `index` (`int`): The index of the choice in the list of choices.
- `message` ([`Message`](message.md)): A chat completion message generated by the model.
- `finish_reason` (`str`): The reason the model stopped generating tokens. This will be `stop` if the model hit a natural stop point or a provided stop sequence, `length` if the maximum number of tokens specified in the request was reached, or `function_call` if the model called a function.
